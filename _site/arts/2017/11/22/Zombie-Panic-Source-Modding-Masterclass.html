<p>The only gaming controversy to come close to the recent anger over micro-transactions is the gradual attempt by greedy publishers and platform owners to monetize the modding scene of their games; freely shared mods that can range from the addition of a new item or player skin, to substantial graphical tweaks, to full-blown new levels and campaigns.</p>

<p>Contained within the understandable outrage directed towards this monetization attempt were many kinds of objections. Some thought that this was a sure-fire way to introduce divisions within the frequently fragile modding community by incentivising an “every man for himself” attitude that would ensure that modding would never again produce important innovations as it had before with the likes of DayZ, Counter-Strike or even the entire MOBA genre. Others felt that the essence of the effort was correct, creators should be compensated for their work, but the implementation, such as the fact that the actual creator would only ever be entitled to 40% of what the mod creator earned, was inexcusable.</p>

<p>All of these objections had their day and the push toward monetization was halted, at least for a little while. But what I feel to be the most important feature of the modding community, that was never properly identified or defended, is the creative and collaborative spirit that many wonderful communities can claim. I can think of no better product of this kind of community than Zombie Panic Source.</p>

<p>ZPS is a completely free multiplayer game built on Valve’s source engine and released in 2007</p>

<p>On average there are 80 people playing it at any one time during the weekday, which creeps up to just over 100 on the weekends.</p>

<p>Over the course of the last 10 years, the initial roster of 8 maps has been added to by hundreds of community made levels and updates.</p>
