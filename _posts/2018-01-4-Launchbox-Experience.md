Just before the summer of 2017 me and two friends won the chance to be mentored and funded by our university over the course of our summer break, all in order to start a successful private company. By the end of the summer we'd all gone our separate ways and our young company was no more. 

It was a wonderfully terrifying time, and I stressed and learned more than any other period in my life, and I wanted to take the opportunity here to begin outlining our story, and eventually prove to you and myself that the failures we experienced over that three month period will go on to drive us to the success that the 3 of us continue to chase.
