Solving The Problem

“Well...it must be said, after a showing like that, we find it quite regrettable that the full extent of this unfortunate issue has only been made clear to us now.”

The bespectacled gentleman had only spoken after the whole room had endured several moments of silence following the conclusion Toner had made to his presentation, the forlorn faces of men, women and children frozen on the large screen taking up the wall next to him. Their haunting eyes stare out at the panel of suited men and women who are seated all along the sturdy oak desk that stretches from the left wall of this grand government meeting room all the way to the right. 

And though the sombre mood in the room keeps all these respectable people silent, Toner allows himself a slight smile in response to the bespectacled man’s statement, the anxiety that had taken root in his stomach now giving way to pride.

“Yeah, well neither was I really till I stopped to listen, ya know? They just ‘ave it so bad an’ there’s no bloody good reason for it, an’ we can help ‘em so much with so little, so I knew I had to start doin’ something, ya know?”

“And evidently you’ve done quite a bit with these plans Mr. Hendricks, quite a bit. I know I speak for the whole committee when I tell you as much.” The rest of the committee do indeed start nodding now, murmuring agreement as they stare down the long desk from both sides toward their plump leader at the centre as he continues. “And I daresay you’d not find anyone in this country who wouldn’t be convinced by the stirring images and arguments you’ve put forward here today, besides perhaps Bolash and his little cult of crypto-facists, hmm?”

Exactly on cue there are chuckles from everyone sitting along the desk, the collective sound bubbling in the background as Toner further relaxes his formerly tense posture.

“That’s great to hear that is, I-, I honestly didn’t know how you’d all take it an’ all, but that’s the best news I could-, cos honestly it’s the families that need help the most right now, the young ones, cos so many of them have babies and that’s hard an’ all, specially now with the economy bein’-”

“Of course Mr. Hendricks, of course, the committee are wholly on the same page as you there, and I’m delighted to say that the plight and initiatives you have covered here are exactly the spirit and practical scope that the Central Executive has so recently offered us such generous funding for.”

Toner can’t do anything to mask his joy now as his mouth widens into a smile that covers his face. 

“Oh that’s fantastic that is!” He turns back toward the projected image, tapping buttons excitedly as the projected images changes, graphs and charts flying past on the wall as he moves from slide to slide. “Cos I mean, like, first things first now, we could solve so many problems at their root an’ all if we can get the first phases of that Housin’ strategy off the ground by the end of the month, and that’d let us get on to-”

A short, sharp laugh comes from behind him, Toner turning back to see the bespectacled gentleman raising a hand genteelly, as if hailing a cab or a waiter. 

“Just a moment Mr. Hendricks, hold your horses, please! We’re not in a race now, are we?”

“I-, I just thought we were startin’ to-”

“But it’s not as simple as just starting at the word ‘go’ Mr. Hendricks, there are certain procedures for serious initiatives such as these, and we do want to be serious about this don’t we? This isn’t mere common charity, like releasing some Christmas jingle or kicking off a football game. Our founding brief as a committee makes it quite clear that there are many important steps that must be taken, with due diligence and in the proper order Mr. Hendricks, before any of our substantial funding can come into play. I’m sure we all understand that, don’t we?”

Nodding and murmuring comes from across the seated committee members as Toner’s face falls slightly.

“Oh, yeah...ok. Sorry. I’m still so new to all this and...I just wanna help as best I can, ya know?”

“It’s quite alright Mr. Hendricks, quite alright. And I must say, it is precisely your sort of starry-eyed, blue-sky, grassroots idealism that makes the perfect compliment to our more sober deliberations. Long may you preserve it!”

There’s a hint of condescension in the bespectacled gentleman’s smile to Toner now, but he ignores it as he gives an uncertain nod in response.

“Right, so, uh, what do I go do now, like? What do I go back and tell the people an’ all?”

“Oh you don’t do anything Mr. Hendricks, no, no, no. It is now our job to write an audit of the project, which I can assure you will be extremely favourable, and it will be this document that will then be presented directly to the Minister herself for final approval, barring a few consultations here and there to bash out some minor details of implementation of course.”

“Wow, uh, right, that sounds pretty...” Toner stops, thinking for a second. “So, uh, how long will all the stuff take then?”

“Well for a case such as this, which I must say again is precisely the sort of thing we have been established and funded for...we could be ready to begin as soon as this time next year.”

Toner’s face drops, eyes blinking as he does his best to pull his jaw back into shape.

“A-a whole year?”

“Oh yes, we really have sped up processes for...but I see you are not exactly thrilled Mr. Hendricks?”

“No, I’m not-, I’m sorry, but it’s-, it’s just, things aren’t good for them out there, ya know?” Toner looks back to the slides, flicking through them until he returns to the image with faces. “They’re out there right now, real people, hurting right now! An’ winter’s coming, an’ not all of ‘em have...like even doing a little right now, some support with food or getting the ones who’re on the streets some tents or...like a little bit now could stop so much getting worse down the line, ya know? I really think right now there’s this opportunity, even if it’s just me goin’ out on my own and-”

“Mr. Hendricks, please.” The gentleman arches his head downwards, smiling slightly. “Once again we appreciate your enthusiasm but these things simply must be done properly, which means no cutting corners and certainly no maverick individualism. Proper procedure must be followed to ensure the best possible outcome to this plight, a plight, and following the sentiment you have just expressed, I want your assurance that you understand me on that point in particular.”

Toner’s hands fidget as the man talks, but he nods along, not voicing any protest.

“Ok, alright, yeah, you all know best an’ all, I know I can’t solve it all myself like, it’s bigger than me and needs a bigger...but look what about the ones who’re on the streets? They got long term problems that need that, uh, that ‘best possible outcome’ thing, yeah, but their short term outcome’s gonna be dyin’ on the street, like. Can’t you do anythin’ for them, anythin’, just make it quick? Even just little stuff, like food or somethin’ to keep ‘em warm?”

The bespectacled gentleman almost seems annoyed as he opens his mouth, then stops, considering for a moment before leaning over to whisper to the man seated on his right and then to the woman on his left. Strangely, while he does this the rest of the committee seem to imitate him, following suit up and down the table, whispering to their nearest neighbour on one side then the next, back and forth, back and forth, until the gentleman clears his throat, silencing them all as he carefully retrains his gaze on Toner.

“After some discussion, the committee believes that the depths of depravity involved-, no no, that’s not the right-, the depths of privation involved, the committee will see about releasing discretionary funds for, well, let’s say...food and blankets over the holiday season? Give out a little Christmas cheer, hmm?”

Toner nods slowly, unsure of this minor success.

“Uh, ok, yeah, that might work ok, so long as there’s more than just blankets comin’ down the line, yeah?”

“Absolutely, Mr. Hendricks, of that you can rest assured. Well then...” 

A hand reaches up to adjust the gentleman’s glasses on his nose as he glances around at his fellow committee members. 

“In conclusion, it must be said that despite the concerns you have raised here today, we are all united in our belief that the problem is now well on its way to being solved.”
* * *
“Well..it must be said after a showing like that, that we find it extremely regrettable the full extent of this calamitous issue is only being made clear to us now.”

The bespectacled gentleman’s words echo louder than they had before, thanks perhaps to the padded leather of his new armchair but more likely due to the confines of the cramped space improvised within the committee’s new headquarters for visiting presentations. The rest of the committee enjoy new furnishings too as they sit now behind individual desks instead of a shared one, each chair bolted into its underlying metal frames reminiscent of school desks. Meanwhile Toner for his part, lacking a projector this time, stands next to a thick paper flipboard as he bites at his lip, considering his response.

“I’m...grateful an’ all for your sympathy, but...fact is the violence’s never been this bad, an’ it’s gettin’ worse cos the media’s runnin’ scared of Bolash’s an’ his crew an’ not reportin’ any of his paramilitary lads, while the cops just-, the point is it’s makin’ the problems there already much, much worse, and without blamin’ no one, that wouldn’t be as big a problem if there’d been some-”

“Of course Mr. Hendricks, we couldn’t agree more! No one regrets our inaction on that front more than us, I can guarantee you that.” Murmurs of agreement come from across the separately seated committee as the gentleman continues. “Alas, hindsight is always 20-20. The snap election was an unfortunate miscalculation on behalf of the party, and what’s more it simply did not occur to anyone that the opposition would stoop so low as to welcome Bolash of all people into such a-, a-, a godless coalition!” This time the murmurs of the committee turn disagreeable, practically mournful in their shared condemnation, but Toner himself remains unmoved.

“Yeah, well, look, I don’t get the politics of it all or nothin’ but things’ve gotten bad out there, for some folks it’s even-, cos, like, the food an’ blankets you mentioned before, that you never got round to, well now people need them or they’re gone, no question bout it, there’ll be no comin’ back, so, like, here an’ today, how we can start helpin’ them? When can we start bleedin’ helpin’?”

“Yes, er, well you see Mr. Hendricks, that’s difficult precisely because of the politics that, in your words, you ‘don’t get’. Simply put, the committee no longer enjoys the unequivocal support of the government we previously held and neither does-, although....” The gentleman sits up a little straighter, a smile now spreading across his face. “It may please you to hear that despite this unfortunate turn of events we have managed to make progress down certain critical avenues.”

“What? You have?”

“Oh yes, on some of the most important and pertinent issues we’d ever faced as a committee!”

Toner blinks, then finally smiles for the first time since he’d stepped inside the room.

“T-that’s brilliant! So the blankets and food, an all the rest of the-, they’re comin’?”

“Oh no, no I don’t think anything material in nature will be possible any time soon at all.”

“But wha-, then what’s your-, what’s the good news?’

“Well we haven’t released our official reports about it yet, but I suppose you are owed something by the committee, however small.” The gentleman arches his back to sit up straight, clearing his throat and looking slowly around the committee, from face to face, as he says with brimming pride: 

“It is my proud privilege to tell you all that, after a far, far too long time, the committee has corrected one of the most fundamental errors in its foundations. It is my pleasure to announce that with the fresh addition of Ms. Campbell to the board the committee has achieved complete gender parity for the first time in its incredible history!”

The committee as a whole bursts into a loud round of self-congratulatory applause, bright white teeth gleaming all around the room as Toner squints with incomprehension.

“You-, what’re you-” 

Despite his confusion the applause continues unabated, the bespectacled gentleman giving small modest bows of his head as he looks all around, until Toner draws in a sharp breath to shout out.

“HEY!” 

The applause stops immediately, and Toner doesn’t let the opportunity slip. 

“Christ’s sake, enough of that! None of this bloody helps the people gettin’ hurt out there, does it? We need to start talkin’ action, right bloody now!”

“Oh, I- well, of course Mr Toner, I-, er, the committee is in full agreement with you there.” The gentleman is nodding sagely, quickly recovering from Toner’s outburst. “But you see the internal composition of the committee is central to-, well no, that is perhaps too subtle a point to make in response to your-, allow me to start over.” The gentleman clears his throat once more, settling back into his seat and giving Toner a benevolent smile. “The fact is Mr. Hendricks, that the party’s recent loss of power may in fact be a blessing in disguise. Although the government has altered significantly in its character now that, inconceivably, Bolash and his henchmen hold a veto, this has pushed us to re-focus all efforts on action and funding primarily toward the private sector, which according to some of our forecasts could in fact make our entire operating processes far smoother.”

“So...things will happen sooner than when you lot were in government, that what you’re sayin’?”

“Oh yes, exactly.” Murmurs of agreement come from the whole committee once more and Toner is almost feels himself begin to relax until the gentleman continues quietly. “Almost certainly. Probably.”

“For the love of-, whaddya mean ‘probably'?”

“Well these things are so much more uncertain outside of the public sphere you see. Greater potential, yes, but greater uncertainty too. Market dynamics can be quite tempestuous, as I’m sure you understand as a-, well no, I suppose you might lack-, just trust us when we say that’s how it is.”

But now Toner can only shake his head in exasperation. 

“Can you you not just tell me when I can go out there an’ tell these people their kids are gonna be gettin’ square meals again, that they’re not gonna to keep losin’ their loved ones to exposure or some gang of jackboots, yeah?”

“Oh Mr. Hendricks, we really can’t say. That’s like asking if you know how many boxes you’ll have to stack in your supermarket on a given day.”

“I don’t stack bloody boxes I run-, look, these people need essentials, right? They need to be safe, but more than anythin’ right now they need some certainty, somethin’ to trust, an’ I’m sorry, I didn’t want to say get into this durin’ the presentation, but fact is some of them are facin’ up to the end.”

“The...end? In what sense Mr. Hendricks?”

“I know it’s a touchy subject with Bolash and his marches an’ all, but they’ve been gettin’ way more viscous, basically huntin’ people now, an’ the attacks have gone up yeah but it’s worse than that cos the damage has too. Some people ain’t even out of hospital yet and others...they might not ever be leavin’. We’re talkin’ major aggro, losin’ fingers an’ eyes, two kids in comas an’...an’ they just can’t deal with it. They’re bottom of the barrel like. We ‘ave to do somethin’. Anythin’.”

The gentleman pushes back in his chair to think, his lips pursing.

“I see.” He glances briefly at the committee members around him before leaning out toward Toner. “It must be said that the possibility of the violence reaching a low quite that deep had escaped the committee up till this very moment, a low of criminality it must be said, but in response I assure you we will certainly work our hardest to get something off the ground to meet this challenge head on as soon as we. Does that sound reasonable Mr. Hendricks?”

“Yeah, sure, I mean you know best like…but it ‘as to work this time. For their sakes”

The gentleman smiles wide as he looks around the room to meet the expectant gaze of the committee around him. “It will work, it will! Trust in our a wisdom greater than yours my dear fellow.” He’s met with met with warm smiles in return and though he turns to find Toner’s own face sullen, he doesn’t let it throw him off for a second.

“In conclusion, it must be said that despite the concerns you’ve raised here today I think we are all united in our belief that the problem is now well on its way to being solved.”

* * *
“Well..it must be said Mr. Hendricks, after a showing like that, that we find it unbearably regrettable that the full extent of this disastrous issue is only being made clear to us now.”

The bunker, for that is what it had been declared the former kitchen would function as, was barely large enough to fit a small family let alone the motley committee that fills it now, all of them still immaculately dressed as ever, but sitting now on the various objects that litter the room: a lucky few teetering on backless wooden stools by the modest dining table at the centre of the room while the unfortunate majority must make do on pots, pans and even the mud-stained floor of the room itself.

Only the bespectacled gentleman sits in anything resembling an actual chair as he and the committee stare dutifully toward Toner where he stands in the doorway to the garden, bathed from behind by the soft orange light coming from the fires burning behind him all throughout the city, his clothes ripped and nose more than a little bloodied as his fists tighten up to crush the handwritten notes he had used to help him make the brief speech he’d just finished.

“Is that all-, Christ, that’s easy for you to say, init? You’ve all still got food an’ a roof while half of the city’s fightin’ tooth an’ nail just to fuckin’ survive!”

“Mr. Hendricks!” The gentleman’s eyes blink in surprise, mouth open in shock. “I must say, the committee are quite aware of how emotionally charged current events have made you, but please for the sake of decency, can you refrain from such language?”

“Oh for the love of-” Toner finishes pushing his notes into a small ball and now flings it into the room, a few committee members dodging awkwardly in their cramped suits as it flies past their heads. ”Swearin’s hardly the main concern now with Bolash’s an’ his storm-troopers torchin’ the whole city, is it?”

“Well it’s, er, never really as simple as that Mr. Hendricks…and in fact it is the firm position of the committee that dignity and politeness may just be the exact sort of tool to help those of us who wish to combat the barbarism displayed by the unfortunate rise of Bolash and his hoard, a menace that it should be made clear was not anticipated by any of our forecasts or by the experts we routinely-” 

“Oh cut all the fuckin’ bullshit already! I’ve been comin’ to you people for-”

“That as may be Mr. Hendricks, however I ask you again not to use any words which-”

“Bullshit is exactly what it is, you all did nothin’! Worse than nothin’, you held me back from doin’ what I coulda done by myself!”

“And that’s what you think Mr. Hendricks! But you are mistaken!”

The committee show visible shock, never having witnessed their leader raise his voice before. For his part Toner seems a little stunned as well as the gentleman continues.

“That’s what you think, that’s clear enough, but the truth of the matter is that we’ve broken precedents during these unprecedented times, and achieved more than we’ve ever achieved before as a committee! Achievements that work to serve the very cause, the suffering you have shared with us so often before, and yet you stand there and tell us we are-”

“Well I’ll bloody believe that when I see it. I bet you’ve all been busy doin’ nothin’, like usual, while I’m-”

“What you fail to appreciate is just how much of our energies were taken up with preventing the rise of the fascist element within our soc-”

“The hell’re you talkin’ bout a rise for?! It fuckin’ happened! Bolash runs everythin’ now!”

“Exactly! And in contrast to the humanitarian plight you have made us so aware of again this evening Mr. Hendricks, we know that the best fight to be fought is against the perversion of civil society perpetuated by Bolash and his cronies, and it is precisely this fight that we have started by landing our own resounding opening blow!” 

The gentleman stops for a moment, allowing a dramatic silence to fill the room as Toner stares at him, the rest of the committee enraptured, all waiting on his final word.

“For you see, we have instigated, and already populated with our very own selves...a petition!”

The committee is all set to erupt into jubilant clapping, but Toner’s voice cuts them off curtly.

“You’re takin’ the fuckin’ piss! A petition to fuckin’ who?”

“Mr. Hendricks, language!”

“To who?!”

“Well...the ultimate recipient is not quite as important as the message, the unity displayed by-”

“Oh fuck this, fuck all of you!” Shaking his head Toner turns to leave. “I’ve had enough of this nonsense, enough of you all, I’m gonna get out there and start-”

“Stop, stop, wait!” 

Toner looks over his shoulder to see confusion in the gentleman’s eyes.

“W-what in God’s name- you mean by yourself? Really? What  in heavens do you think you can accomplish without the support of the committee Mr. Hendricks?”

“I’ll-, well I don’t fuckin’ know, but I’ll do whatever I can. With whatever’s left.”

He takes another decisive step away just as the gentleman leaps up from his chair behind him.
 
“No, wait Mr. Hendricks! Just a second, please! Just, let me ask you...”

Toner hesitates, glancing back to the gentleman as he stands by his chair and pats his hands all over his suit until finally he pulls out a heavy golden fountain pen from his breast pocket, holding it out toward Toner as he asks:

“Would you at least sign the petition before you leave?”

Toner stares blankly back at him for a moment before his face suddenly twists up in disgust, his mouth beginning to form a curse but stopping midway through, shaking his head as he lets out a grunt and leaves without uttering another word. The whole committee stare after him for a few seconds and then, slowly, the gentleman turns and sits back down in his seat, adjusting the glasses perched on his nose.

“Well then...forgiving the misgivings of our, er, unfortunately uncouth associate I must say that, despite the concerns raised here today, I can say with utmost confidence that the problem is well on its way to being solved.”

* * *
“Well..it must be said after a showing like that, it is extraordinarily regrettable that the full extent of this disgraceful issue is only being made clear to us now.”

There’s a soft flurry of movement throughout the whole of the courtroom as numerous upstanding citizens shift on their benches and murmur their agreement, joined in this by the familiar ambience contributed by the committee from where they sit in the juror’s box of the courtroom, which sits just a few feet away from the high podium holding aloft the bespectacled gentleman in his judge’s chair. All are united in the contempt they radiate for the bound and shackled figure sitting alone in the centre of the room, a glassy eyed, silent Toner, shackled head to toe.

“Throughout all of today’s proceedings it has been clear that the accused has not only shown complete disregard for his fellows citizens and a complete contempt for the values that make Our Fatherland strong, but has also shamelessly planned aid and support for an enemy and alien group within our borders. Grievously, the accused carried these horrid plans into action, and although to the great glory of Our Fatherland the Purification Forces were able to liquidate a majority of the filth, it is entirely the fault of the accused’s that some remnants likely remain hidden in our fair country, an unforgivable treason against all that Our Great State holds dear.”

The gentleman pauses as the jeers in the courtroom become momentarily too loud for him to be heard, but soon resumes as the noise dutifully dies away.

“Finally, and perhaps most disturbingly, the accused has answered all these charges with what can only be described as contemptuous indifference, maintaining an arrogant and unforgivable silence throughout the entirety of these lawful proceedings. It is for this reason in particular that I wish for a moment to speak personally to the accused, to offer a brief and pointed admonishment that I hope will go some way toward restoring the stained dignity of Our Blood, Our People and Our Land.”

The gentleman gives a nod, and on cue a large, burly man in jackboots marches from the wings toward Toner and briskly unlocks the chains binding him to his chair, leaving much of the rest of his body still bound by chains as he drags Toner past the glaring committee and toward the gentleman’s high chair. Once there, the gentleman dismisses the guard with a wave of his hand, placing his other one gently over the small microphone before him as he leans down toward Toner to whisper:

“I do want you to know that I and the rest of the newly instated Committee Of Our People’s Justice are, as ever, united in our admiration and sympathy for your beliefs and conviction. This of course makes this whole judicial parade quite regrettable on our part, as I’m sure you understand.”

Toner remains unmoved as he speaks, but the gentleman doesn’t seem to notice as he continues.

“However, as we are sure you understand, as ever we are quite powerless to stop the wheels of power once they are in motion, which is not to say that you didn’t have some chance to change the motion of those wheels somewhat if you hadn’t chosen to go ahead and so rashly take matters into your own hands and...well I suppose we reap what we sow don’t we Mr. Hendricks? Chin up now.”

The gentleman motions for Toner to be returned to his former restraints, and, once firmly fastened to his chair once more, a suited figure from among the committee members in the box stands up to address the room at large.

“Brothers And Sisters In Blood, in full faith with Our Fatherland we are proud to declare a verdict of guilty on all counts for the accused, with a recommendation for the strongest possible punishment.” Suddenly their left arm flies up to touch their forehead as they cry out. “Glory to Bolash!”

All in the courtroom rise and repeat the cry with a salute of their own, save of course for Toner whose slouched figure remains unmoved, the hateful focus of every eye in the room as the gentleman slowly retakes his seat, ready to pass the ultimate sentence.

“Toner Hendricks, for your despicable crimes against the Fatherland you are condemned to Public Purification, a fittingly torturous and lethal end in return for your despicable crimes. Bailiff, prepare the condemned for scourging.”

Toner is grabbed roughly, completely passive as strong hands pick him up and drag him toward the courtroom’s doors, jeers and debris thrown at him from all around as he is brought outside.

Back on his perch, the bespectacled gentleman gives a quiet sigh before turning and leaning down toward the committee with a small smile. 

“I must say, despite the many concerns raised along the way, I think we are all united in saying that, at long last, the problem has finally been solved.”
