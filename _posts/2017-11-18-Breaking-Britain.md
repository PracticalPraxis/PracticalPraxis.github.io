## May She Leave Now?

The trajectory of the current British government implies that we will very soon be seeing an end to Britain's
second ever female leader of state. Between her own personal gaffes and miscalculations, from her general election
floundering to her poor bluff at a hard Brexit, Theresa May's tensure will by no stretch be remembered as a successful one.

## Corbyn-ocylypse
So who will succeed her? At the current rate, the leadership of the Conservative party appears to many to be a poisoned chalice.
Neither Johnson, Gove, Leadsom or Mogg are eager to take the imminent battering that the position is currently hurtling toward. 

This naturally presents a brilliant oppourtunity for the opposition - Jeremy Corbyn. Corbyn is nothing less than an existentalist threat
to the running of all British politics in the last 30 years.
