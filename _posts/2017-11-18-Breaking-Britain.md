The two most prominent British political figures are currently moving along opposing trajectories; Theresa May faces a steep decline from the respected and hardy image she was projecting up until her mauling at the general election, while Jeremy Corbyn seems set to ride a wave of disruptive populism straight to No. 10. 

What these two forces together present is nothing short of a new paradigm for British politics. What should most concern us however, is whether or not this is a change for the better.

## May She Leave Now?

The state of the current British government implies that we will very soon be seeing an end to Britain's
second ever female leader of state. Between her cabinet's many personal gaffes, from Patel to Johnson, to her own general election
floundering to the dysfunctional approach taken toward leaving the EU, Theresa May's tenure will by no stretch of the imagination be remembered as a successful one. But what can we expect in her wake?

## Corbyn-pocylypse
At the current rate, the task of leading the Conservative party appears to be a poisoned chalice.
None of the senior Conservative figures, not Johnson, Gove, Leadsom or, recently, Mogg, are in any way eager to take upon themselves the imminent and highly damaging battering 
that anyone holding the position seems set to face thanks to further failures in key political arenas such as the response to the Grenfell or Brexit negotiations.

This naturally presents a brilliant opportunity for the opposition - Jeremy Corbyn. As well as being the leader of the largest non-Conservative party in Britain, Corbyn is also nothing less
than an existentialist opposition to the running of all British politics in the last 30 years.

As a classic British socialist, imported directly from the 70's, Corbyn seeks to change the linear path of privatization and de-regulation that has been at the core of British politics since Thatcher and
implement full blown socialist policies.

In addition, Corbyn is likely to take a drastically different approach to the Brexit negotiations than is currently being taken by the Conservatives. The Shadow Foreign Secretary, Keir Starmer, has been forthright in stating that a Labor government would seek a transitional arrangement in talks with Brussels. Such an arrangement is anathema to the driving forces behind the vote to Leave; as they see it, any brake being applied to the leaving process will quickly morph into further stalling and eventual backtracking.
