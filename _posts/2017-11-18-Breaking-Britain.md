## May She Leave Now?

The trajectory of the current British government implies that we will very soon be seeing an end to Britain's
second ever female leader of state. Between her own personal gaffes and miscalculations, from her general election
floundering to her poor bluff at a hard Brexit, Theresa May's tenure will by no stretch of the imagination be remembered as a successful one.

## Corbyn-pocylypse
So who will succeed her? At the current rate, the task of leading the Conservative party appears to be a poisoned chalice.
None of the senior Conservative figures, not Johnson, Gove, Leadsom or, recently, Mogg, are in any way eager to take upon themselves the imminent and highly damaging battering 
that anyone holding the position seems set to face thanks to further failures in key political arenas such as the response to the Grenfell or Brexit negotiations.

This naturally presents a brilliant opportunity for the opposition - Jeremy Corbyn. As well as being the leader of the largest non-Conservative party in Britain, Corbyn is also nothing less
than an existentialist opposition to the running of all British politics in the last 30 years.

As a classic British socialist, imported directly from the 70's, Corbyn seeks to change the linear path of privatization and de-regulation that has been at the core of British politics since Thatcher and
implement full blown socialist policies.
